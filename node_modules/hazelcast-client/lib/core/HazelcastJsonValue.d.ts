/**
 * HazelcastJsonValue is a wrapper for JSON formatted strings. It is preferred
 * to store HazelcastJsonValue instead of Strings for JSON formatted strings.
 * Users can run predicates and use indexes on the attributes of the underlying
 * JSON strings.
 *
 * HazelcastJsonValue is queried using Hazelcast's querying language.
 * See {@link https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-nodejs-client#77-distributed-query Distributed Query section}.
 *
 * In terms of querying, numbers in JSON strings are treated as either
 * Long or Double in the Java side. Strings, booleans and null
 * are treated as their Java counterparts.
 *
 * HazelcastJsonValue keeps given string as it is. Strings are not
 * checked for being valid. Ill-formatted json strings may cause false
 * positive or false negative results in queries.
 *
 * Null values are not allowed.
